While pursuing wildly different types of work, the mission of each organization is centered around community outreach and participation. The primary project objective is the expansion of BRIC and UrbanGlass to the vacant ground floor and to visually open the building to the street. Leeser Architecture juggled complex programmatic demands and highly specific uses to create an open and accessible arts facility that can connect the community as well as invite them inside to engage with the myriad of activities occurring within.</p><p>Leeser Architectureâ€™s renovation and expansion of this existing, under-utilized building involves two user groups, BRIC Arts | Media | Brooklyn and UrbanGlass. The project includes a full renovation of the interior space to create new theaters, television broadcasting studios, art galleries, glass workshops, media labs, classrooms, administrative and operation offices, and support spaces."
